# Customer
Project created for the company Capgemini

SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

This application was configured to run on port 5001.

I installed the swagger package to help me to document the API. Then, you can access by:

http://localhost:5001/swagger
I tried to keep the solution clean as possible.

This app was build with
.Net Core 5.0
xunit
FluentAssertions
Swashbuckle
AutoMapper
InMemory Provider Entity Framework

Posman requests are in the folder named:
Capgemini.postman_collection.json

Thank you so much
